# Rajul-s-Website
This is my website!
I created the website in the process of trying to learn css and Javascript.
To get ideas and learn different CSS commands, I surfed the internet for quite a while.
I have still got immense work to do in order to get comfortable with css. But for starters, I am satisfied with the way it turned out to be.
